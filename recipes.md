1. Rince and cook the rice
This is a crucial step if you want your homemade sushi to come out well. This is how you rinse the rice: put a glass of rice in a strainer and rinse it with plenty of water.

Repeat the process 5 or 6 times. You will know you have finished rinsing the rice when the water stops having a whitish color. The purpose of this process is to soften the rice and get the exact texture that the Japanese sushi rice has. 

Once you have rinsed the rice, put some water to boil and cook it for as long as the label of the product says. Use 2 or 3 measures more of water than rice, so it is well cooked. Then put a bit of salt in it.

2. Cool and dry the rice
This step is also essential in your homemade recipe. Once the rice is done, put it on a flat plate or on a platter and let it cool for some minutes. 

While you leave the rice to cool, put a finger of sugar in your measuring glass and then a little more than a finger of apple vinegar in the same glass. Mix both ingredients in the glass until the sugar dissolves, and incorporate this mixture progressively to the rice, once it is dry.

It is important not to put all the vinegar with the sugar at once on the rice. It is enough to spread the liquid slowly with the help of a spoon and stir the rice gently so that it is impregnated with the vinegar.

3. Start shaping the rice
For this step, it is important to have a bowl with clean water in it, because you will wet your hands with it and you will give shape to the rolls. 

Once you have clean and wet hands, take some rice and knead it a bit, giving it a slightly elongated shape. It is important to compact the rice and give it a cylindric shape without losing thickness. 

4. Put rice on the algae
On the bamboo rolling mat, but without covering it completely, place a sheet of nori algae. On top of this, extend the amount of rice that we have taken with our hands. It is important to set the algae and the mat on a large table or any stable flat surface.

Create a flat layer of rice which will cover the rest of the ingredients. Extend the rice throughout the whole surface of the algae; except for a space of two centimeters at the end of the seaweed opposite to you, which you should leave without any rice.

To extend the rice, do it slowly and without pressing it too hard. Wet your hands from time to time so the rice moves easily.

5. Make the sushi roll
This is the last step in this sushi recipe. Once you have the layer of rice, put a bit of mild sauce or mayonnaise across the width and more or less in the lower third of the surface covered with rice (this step is optional).

Then put the chosen ingredients on the layer of rice. For instance, the surimi sticks, and the avocado, the salmon or any other ingredient you want next to it. 

To create the sushi roll, roll the algae forward with the help of the bamboo mat, making stops each time we have completed a turn. It is important to press the algae towards you so that the roll is compressed, but without pressing it too much.

Once the roll is done and the bamboo mat removed, cut the sushi so that all the pieces are the same size. To do this, the knife should be very sharp, and it helps to wet it a bit before cutting. It is also important to cut fast and precise, to avoid losing the shape.

6. Serve
To finish we serve the maki and you can eat them with soy sauce and other complements, such as wasabi paste or ginger slices. You can also add a little sesame.
